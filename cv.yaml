about: 'I am a PhD candidate at the Language Technologies Institute at <b>Carnegie Mellon University</b>. I am advised by [Dr. Louis-Philippe Morency (LP)](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~morency/) in the Multicomp Lab and we work on anything multimodal. Lately, my research efforts have been directed towards <b>grounding body gestures</b> in Speech, and Language. As an undergraduate researcher at <b>Indian Institute of Technology(IIT), Kanpur</b>, I worked with [Dr. Rajesh Hegde](http://home.iitk.ac.in/~rhegde/) on <b>Spatial Audio</b> and <b>Speaker Diarization</b>, and [Dr. Vinay Namboodiri](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/vinaypn/) on <b>Video Summarization</b>.
